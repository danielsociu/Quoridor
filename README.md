# Quoridor - minigame

This project is a simple minigame called quoridor.  
It's a 2 player game in which the end goal is reaching the other side of the map with your pawn, or to not let your enemy reach it before you.  
To slow down your enemy you can place a 2 blocks long wall anywhere you want as long as your enemy can still reach the goal.  

It also has 2 algorithms for AI:  

1. min max
2. alpha beta  

### You can simply run the project with python:  

    python quoridor.py
